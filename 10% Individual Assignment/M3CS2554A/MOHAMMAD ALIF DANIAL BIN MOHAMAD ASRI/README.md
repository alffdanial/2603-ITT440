📌 INTRODUCTION

In today’s digital environment, urban infrastructure systems are required to 
handle large-scale data efficiently. Traditional sequential programming executes 
tasks one at a time, resulting in significant delays when processing vehicle 
physics updates. This project demonstrates optimization via parallel programming.

📊 PROJECT OVERVIEW

A high-performance traffic monitoring system checking physics logic for 5,000 
vehicle agents. Features classification logic and performance benchmarking.

🧩 CHALLENGES FACED
* GIL Limitations: Overcoming the Global Interpreter Lock that slows threading.
* Data Scale: Managing physics updates for 5,000 agents in real-time.
* System Overhead: Balancing the number of processes with available CPU cores.

💡 CONCLUSION

Multiprocessing is the superior choice for CPU-bound simulations, bypasses 
the GIL, and achieves maximum hardware utilization.
